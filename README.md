    <h1>React Native Chat App</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple chat app built using React Native. The app allows users
      to start a chat conversation and continue the conversation with
      text messages. The app uses react Navigation for screen navigation and
      react-native-gesture-handler for gesture recognition.
    </p>
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family</li>
      <li>As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.</li>
